However, removing the DPF is not only about the advantages. There are also some drawbacks and risks that you should be aware of before deciding to delete the component. Here are some of them:
 
- Removing the DPF is illegal in most countries and regions. It violates the emission standards and regulations that aim to protect the environment and human health. You may face fines, penalties, or even legal actions if you are caught driving a vehicle without a DPF.
- Removing the DPF may void your car's warranty and insurance. Some manufacturers and insurers may not cover your vehicle if they find out that you have modified or tampered with the emission control system. You may also have difficulties passing the annual inspection or MOT test without a DPF.
- Removing the DPF may increase the noise level of your exhaust system. The DPF acts as a muffler that reduces the sound of the engine and the exhaust gases. Without it, your car may become louder and more annoying to you and others.

Therefore, before you decide to remove the DPF from your vehicle, you should weigh the pros and cons carefully. You should also consult with a professional tuner who can advise you on the best option for your car and your needs.
